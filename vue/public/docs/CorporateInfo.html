            The Board of Directors of EVehicle, Inc. (the "Company") sets high
            standards for the Company's employees, officers and directors. Implicit in
            this philosophy is the importance of sound corporate governance. It is the
            duty of the Board of Directors to serve as a prudent fiduciary for
            shareholders and to oversee the management of the Company's business. To
            fulfill its responsibilities and to discharge its duty, the Board of
            Directors follows the procedures and standards that are set forth in these
            guidelines. These guidelines are subject to modification from time to time
            as the Board of Directors deems appropriate in the best interests of the
            Company or as required by applicable laws and regulations.

            These Corporate Governance Guidelines are established by the Board of
            Directors of EVehicle Motors, Inc. to provide a structure within which our
            directors and management can effectively pursue EVehicle’s objectives for
            the benefit of our stockholders. The Board intends these guidelines to
            serve as a flexible framework within which the Board may conduct its
            business, not as a set of binding legal obligations. These guidelines
            should be interpreted in the context of all applicable laws, EVehicle’s
            charter documents and other governing legal documents and EVehicle
            policies, which shall prevail in the case of a conflict with these
            guidelines.

            II. Board Structure and Composition
        </h3>
        <p align="left">
            <strong> </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            1. <u>Size of the Board</u>. The authorized number of directors will be
            determined from time to time by resolution of the Board.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. <u>Board Membership Criteria</u>. EVehicle’s Nominating and Corporate
            Governance Committee reviews and makes recommendations to the Board
            regarding the composition and size of the Board, determines the relevant
            criteria (including any
        </p>
        <p>
            minimum qualifications), and recommends to the Board the slate of nominees
            for election at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders or nominees for election
            to fill interim vacancies on the Board.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. <u>Director Independence</u>. A majority of directors on the Board will
            be independent as required by the NASDAQ Stock Market. The Board also
            believes that it is often in the best interest of EVehicle and its
            stockholders to have non-independent directors, including current and (in
            some cases) former members of management, serve as directors. Each
            independent director who experiences a change in circumstances that could
            affect such director’s independence should deliver a notice of such change
            to EVehicle’s General Counsel.
        </p>
        <p>
            4. <u>Director Tenure</u>. Directors are reelected every three years and
            the Board does not believe it should establish term limits because
            directors who have developed increasing insight into EVehicle and its
            operations over time provide an increasing contribution to the Board as a
            whole.
        </p>
        <p>
            5. <u>Lead Independent Director.</u> An important component of the Board’s
            leadership structure is having a Lead
        </p>
        <p>
            Independent Director in place with broad authority to direct the actions of
            the independent directors and regularly communicate with the Chief
            Executive Officer.
        </p>
        <h3>
            III. Principal Duties of the Board of Directors
        </h3>
        <p align="left">
            <strong> </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            1. <u>To Oversee Management and Evaluate Strategy</u>. The fundamental
            responsibility of the Board is to exercise their business judgment to act
            in what they reasonably believe to be the best interests of EVehicle and
            its stockholders. It is the duty of the Board to oversee management’s
            performance to ensure that EVehicle operates in an effective, efficient and
            ethical manner. Additionally, the Board has responsibility for risk
            oversight, with reviews of certain areas being conducted by the relevant
            board committees.
        </p>
        <p>
            Directors are expected to invest the time and effort necessary to
            understand EVehicle’s business and financial strategies and challenges. The
            basic duties of the directors include attending Board and committee
            meetings and actively participating in Board and committee discussions.
            Directors are also expected to make themselves available outside of board
            meetings for advice and consultation.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. <u>To Select the Chair and Chief Executive Officer</u>. The Board will
            select the chairman of the Board and the chief executive officer in
            compliance with EVehicle’s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. <u>To Evaluate Management Performance and Compensation</u>.
            Periodically, the Compensation Committee will evaluate the performance of
            the chief executive officer and other executive officers and review and
            approve the compensation plans, policies and arrangements for such
            executives. It will also evaluate the compensation plans, policies and
            programs for officers and employees to ensure they are appropriate,
            competitive and properly reflect EVehicle’s objectives and performance.
        </p>
        <p>
            4. <u>To Review Management Succession Planning</u>. The Nominating and
            Corporate Governance Committee will periodically review the succession
            planning for EVehicle’s executive officers, report its findings and
            recommendations to the Board, and work with the Board in evaluating
            potential successors to these executive management positions.
        </p>
        <p>
            5. <u>To Monitor and Manage Potential Conflicts of Interest</u>. The
            Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for
            considering questions of possible conflicts of interest of Board members
            and of corporate officers and reviewing actual and potential conflicts of
            interest of Board members and corporate officers. The Audit Committee will
            review and approve all related party transactions for which audit committee
            approval is required by applicable law or the rules of the NASDAQ Stock
            Market.
        </p>
        <p>
            6. <u>To Ensure the Integrity of Financial Information</u>. The Audit
            Committee assists the Board in oversight of the integrity of EVehicle’s
            financial statements, EVehicle’s compliance with legal and regulatory
            requirements and EVehicle's internal accounting and financial controls. The
            Audit Committee reports to the Board on a regular basis regarding such
            oversight.
        </p>
        <p>
            7. <u>To Monitor the Effectiveness of Board Governance Practices</u>. The
            Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will review and evaluate the
            effectiveness of the governance practices under which the Board operates
            and make changes to these practices as needed.
        </p>
        <p>
            8. <u>To Oversee Environmental, Social, and Governance Matters.</u> The
            Board will review the effectiveness of the Company’s environmental, social
            and governance (ESG) initiatives and programs, including its annual Impact
            Report and other related disclosures.
        </p>

            IV. Board Procedures
        </h3>
        <p align="left">
            <strong> </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Directors are expected to prepare for, attend, and contribute meaningfully
            in all Board and applicable committee meetings in order to discharge their
            obligations. Consistent with their fiduciary duties, directors are expected
            to maintain the confidentiality of the deliberations of the Board and its
            committees.
        </p>
        <p>
            1. <u>Frequency of Board Meetings</u>. Regular meetings of the Board shall
            be held at such times and places as determined by the Board. There will be
            at least four regularly scheduled Board meetings each year, but the Board
            will meet more often if necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. <u>Other Commitments</u>. Each member of the Board is expected to ensure
            that other existing and future commitments, including employment
            responsibilities and service on the boards of other entities, do not
            materially interfere with the member’s service as director. Board members
            should not have more public company memberships than would allow them to
            effectively and productively be a member of EVehicle’s board.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. <u>Executive Sessions of Independent Directors</u>. NASDAQ rules require
            independent Board members to regularly meet in executive session. The

            EVehicle believes that more closely aligning the interests of our
            directors, management and employees with those of our stockholders is

        <p align="left">
            1. <u>Minimum Stock Ownership Requirement</u>. Each director and our Chief
            Executive Officer will be required to meet the following minimum stock
            ownership requirements: (i) each director shall own shares of EVehicle
            stock equal in value to at least five times the annual cash retainer for
            directors (exclusive of retainer amounts for service as lead independent
            director or as a member or chair of a Board committee); and (ii) our Chief
            Executive Officer shall own shares of EVehicle stock equal in value to at
            least six times his/her base salary. Our directors and Chief Executive
            Officer shall have five years from the later of (i) March 3,

            to come into compliance with these ownership requirements. Compliance with
            the minimum stock ownership level will be determined on the date when the
            grace period set forth above expires, and annually on each December 31
            thereafter, by multiplying the number of shares held by each director and
            Chief Executive Officer and the average closing price of those shares
            during the preceding month.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. <u>Minimum Vesting Period for Time-Based Equity Awards</u>. No equity
            award as to which vesting or the lapse of a period of restriction occurs
            based solely on the passage of time that is granted to a “named executive
            officer” (as defined in Item 402 (a) of Regulation S-K promulgated under
            the Securities Act of 1933) may vest, or have a period of restriction that
            lapses, earlier than six (6) months from the date on which such vesting or
            lapse commences.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. <u>Post-Vesting Holding Requirement for Equity Awards</u>. No named
            executive officer may sell, transfer, pledge, assign, or otherwise dispose
            of any shares of EVehicle stock acquired pursuant to any stock option,
            restricted stock unit or other equity award granted by EVehicle earlier
            than the date that is six (6) months after the date on which such award
            vests or the period of restriction with respect to such award lapses, as
            applicable.
        </p>
        <p>
            4. <u>Equity Award Repricing</u>. Except with stockholder approval or as an
            adjustment made pursuant to certain fundamental corporate transactions,
            EVehicle will not (a) lower or reduce the exercise price of an outstanding
            equity award, (b) cancel, exchange or surrender any outstanding equity
            award in exchange for cash or another award for the purpose of repricing
            the award; or (c) cancel, exchange or surrender any outstanding equity
            award in exchange for an award with an exercise price that is less than the
            exercise price of the original award.

            The Board shall, in all appropriate circumstances, require reimbursement of
            any annual incentive payment or long-term incentive payment to an executive
            officer of EVehicle where: (1) the payment was predicated upon achieving
            certain financial results that were subsequently the subject of a financial
            restatement of EVehicle’s financial statements; and (2) a lower payment
            would have been made to the executive based upon the restated financial
            results.
        </p>
        <p>
            In each such instance, EVehicle will, to the extent practicable, seek to
            recover from the individual executive the amount by which the individual
            executive’s incentive payments for the relevant period exceeded the lower
            payment that would have been made based on the restated financial results.
